        "description": "The usual ship of the line of most modestly-funded frontier navies, a corvette is a true warship, albeit of a minimal size. While it is unable to land on worlds with standard gravity, its cargo lighter allows crew and cargo transit from the surface of a world, and its extended stores allow for more than four months of field operation under normal crew parameters. Most pirates flying reworked free merchants or stolen patrol boats will turn tail as soon as a corvette shows up in the region. Good armor, multiple ship-killing guns, and trained boarding marines make a corvette a death sentence to most stellar ruffians, and even when a pirate wolf pack can bring one down, it usually comes at the cost of crippling damage. The model depicted here is standard for anti-piracy and basic system defense missions. Against cruiser-class warships, however, this corvette\u2019s weapons have insufficient armor penetration to seriously threaten such a major warship.",

The tremendous weight of fire these ships put out can pop a cruiser in a single firing pass, and its reinforced hull plating shrugs off all but the heaviest armor-piercing blows. Where cruisers often require hunter-killer frigates to take them out, battleships commonly require hunter-killer cruisers to disable them.  The main weakness of a battleship is the fact that it is only a single ship\u2026 a single, extremely expensive ship. It can only attack or defend a single location at a time, and an enemy that has the time and resources to build specialized anti-capital ships with AP weaponry and expendable crews can bring the battleship down for far less money than it cost to build it.",

They have considerable spike drive reach and are faster in-system than most of their potential targets. While their single mounted gun is vulnerable to being disabled by expert enemy gunners, the relatively thick armor of the ship and skilled damage control crew can mitigate that danger. A few patrol boats replace their survey sensor array with a sandthrower to up-gun the ship, but most prefer the additional edge in scanning potential smugglers.",

        "description": "Sometimes confusingly called a \u201clight cruiser\u201d, a heavyfrigate pushes the engineering parameters of a frigate hull to the maximum available to most TL4 worlds. Equipped with a torpedo launcher capable of threatening even cruiser-class enemies, the heavy frigate can intimidate any ship of its weight class. Its heavy crew complement and military drop pod fitting allow it to quickly dispatch well-armed marines to hot spots throughout a solar system.  However, despite the large weapon loadout, the heavy frigate remains a frigate. Its armor is significantly inferior to that of a true cruiser-class warship, and most frigates built for same-class engagements can be a meaningful threat to it. It comes into its own as a bludgeon against the other small warships likely to be fielded by a peer star-faring polity.",
